# CES Track

## Overview

The **Community Extension Service (CES) Tracker** is a dedicated application developed for students 
at the University of San Carlos. Its primary purpose is to facilitate the recording, monitoring, and
management of CES points accumulated through community service activities. This tool ensures that 
students meet their service requirements for graduation in a transparent and organized manner.

> Note: This student-focused version is designed to operate entirely on the userâ€™s local device, 
offering complete offline functionality. It does not include administrative features such as 
activity approval, rejection, or point rule management.

- **Offline Operation**: Fully functional without internet access, ideal for low-connectivity environments.
- **Self-Service Management**: Empowers students to take charge of their community service tracking.
